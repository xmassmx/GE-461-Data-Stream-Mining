# GE-461-Data-Stream-Mining

Hi, 

This repository contains my work for the fifth project of the GE-461: Introduction to Data Science course. 

In  this  project,  our  objective  is  to explore  the  concept  of  classification ofdata  streams.
We generate data  streams  with  varying  noise  and  drift  features.
Then  we  implement K  Nearest Neighbors  (KNN), Hoeffding  Tree  (HT),  and  Na√Øve  Bayes  (NB)  with  varying  batch  sizes  to analyze  online  learners, and  we  implement  Majority  Voting  (MV)  and  Weighted  Majority Voting (WMV) in order to observe the performance of ensemble methods.
Finally, we also take a look at another way to increase the performance of our models.
